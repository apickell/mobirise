During second semester, was enrolled in a project management class. I felt more cognitively stimulated and freely creative. Because of this course, I changed my major to business and technology to begin the upcoming August.&nbsp;</p>

The group I travelled with, G.O.E.S., consisted of 30 students in addition to our three organization leaders. Together, we worked to build four houses for the chosen families.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When it came time to declare a business and a technology concentration, computer science was a no-brainer, but it was difficult to decide between marketing and management. After a bit of research, I discovered that it was possible to take some graduate courses over my college career in order to obtain a graduate certificate. I declared my business concentration as marketing, and began taking courses for a project management graduate certificate.&nbsp;</p>

Chambers School- a school for children with special needs from kindergarten to 8th grade. We re-wired the foot pedals of children's ride-along cars and created a push button instead. This is a cheaper and more enjoyable alternative to a wheelchair for children with little-to-no leg mobility. In order to provide the materials, we gathered donations for the research. Our advisor recently received a grant for the project which we used to purchase more cars for the school to use in their physical therapy program.&nbsp;</p>

                            Stevens Institute of Technology offers a week-long program for high school students to experience a specific subject matter on campus. These subjects ranged from engineering to business to the arts. I assisted the entrepreneurship teacher throughout the week. I coordinated site visits to emerging entrepreneurial companies and established relations with each student. I also provided my own personal experiences to ensure their success and to enrich the studentsâ€™ learning experience of potential career opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
